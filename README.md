# E-commerce Product Catalog Project

Hey there! üëã This is my submission for the Frontend Developer internship position. I built a modern e-commerce product catalog that shows my skills with React, Next.js, and responsive design.

## What I Built
I created an online store with a clean, modern design that works great on both desktop and mobile. Users can:
- Browse through products with a nice grid layout
- Search for products with instant suggestions
- Filter products by category, price, and ratings
- Add items to their cart and manage quantities
- View detailed product pages with multiple images
- See related products
- Switch between light and dark themes

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js & React**: For building a fast, modern web app
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling everything without writing tons of CSS
- **Context API**: For managing the shopping cart state
- **DummyJSON API**: For getting product data

## Cool Features I Implemented

### Smart Search üîç
The search bar gives you suggestions as you type, just like you'd expect from a modern e-commerce site. I added a small delay (debouncing) to make sure we don't overwhelm the API with requests.

### Shopping Cart üõí
The cart updates in real-time when you add or remove items. I used React's Context API to manage this - it was a great way to learn about state management!

### Responsive Design üì±
Everything looks good whether you're on a phone, tablet, or desktop. I spent extra time making sure the layout adjusts smoothly between different screen sizes.

### Error Handling ‚ö°
I added loading states and error messages throughout the app to make sure users always know what's happening, especially when things go wrong.

## What I Learned
This project really helped me understand:
- How to structure a React project with multiple components
- Managing global state with Context API
- Creating responsive layouts with Tailwind CSS
- Handling user interactions and API calls
- Implementing search and filter functionality
- Working with image galleries and product data

## Running the Project
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000`

## Future Improvements
If I had more time, I would:
- Add user authentication
- Implement a checkout process
- Add product reviews and ratings
- Include more filter options
- Add product sorting
- Improve loading speed with caching

Thanks for checking out my project! I'm looking forward to discussing it further in an interview.
